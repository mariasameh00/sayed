<h3>The Four types of AI:</h3>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">1. Reactive machines : <br>
 are the simplest level of robot. They cannot create memories or use information learnt to influence future decisions.they are only able to react to presently existing situations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">
	2. Limited Memory: <br>
A limited memory machine, as the name might suggest, is able to retain some information learned from observing previous events or data. It can build knowledge using that memory in conjunction with pre-programmed data. Self-driving cars for instance store pre-programmed data – i.e. lane markings and maps, alongside observing surrounding information such as the speed and direction of nearby cars, or the movement of nearby pedestrians.

	3. Theory of Mind: <br>
Human beings have thoughts and feelings, memories or other brain patterns that drive and influence their behaviour. It is based from this psychology that theory of mind researchers work, hoping to develop computers that are able to imitate human mental models. That is – machines that are able to understand that people and animals have thoughts and feelings that can affect their own behaviour. <br> <br>
4. Self-awareness: <br>
Self-awareness AI machines are the most complex that we might ever be able to envision and are described by some as the ultimate goal of AI.
These are machines that have human-level consciousness and understand their existence in the world. They don’t just ask for something they need, they understand that they need something; ‘I want a glass of water’ is a very different statement to ‘I know I want a glass of water’.
